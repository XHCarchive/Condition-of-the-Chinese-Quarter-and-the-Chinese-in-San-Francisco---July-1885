"homophily, love as love of the same, closes the world it pretends to open; it makes cyberspace a series of echo chambers."
"homophily (love as love of the same) fuels pattern discrimination. The fact that networks perpetuate segregation should surprise no one because, again, segregation in the form of homophily lies at their conceptual core. Homophily launders hate into collective love, a transformation that, as Sara Ahmed has shown, grounds modern white supremacism (2004, 123). Homophily reveals and creates boundaries within theoretically flat and diffuse networks; it distinguishes and discriminates between allegedly equal nodes: it is a tool for discovering bias and inequality and for perpetuating it in the name of "comfort," predictability, and common sense."
"Homophily is the mechanism by which individuals "stick" together, and "wes" emerge. It is crucial to what Ara Ahmed has diagnosed as "the cultural politics of emotion": a circulation of emotions as a form of capital."
