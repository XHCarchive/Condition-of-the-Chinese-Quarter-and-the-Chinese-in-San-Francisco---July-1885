"the word discrimination originates from Latin verb discriminare, where it simply means "to separate, to distinguish, or to make a distinction," it was in the late nineteenth century that it became overtly political. In parallel to the development of racist ideology, discrimination since then has referred to a prejudicial treatment of individuals based on a social category (e.g., race, gender, sexuality, age, class). However, in different terminologies the original meaning of the term has been preserved. This is why in computer science "pattern discrimination" is still used as a technical term to describe the imposition of identity on input data, in order to filter (i.e., to discriminate) information from it. But far from being a neutral process, the delineation and application of patterns is in itself a highly political issue, even if hidden behind a technical terminology."
- Clemens Apprich, "Introduction," "Pattern Discrimination"
